# SafeRun
Start of a project that would let people stay informed about safe running spaces in their area.

Too many people I'm friends with feel unsafe while running, and it's no secret that running alone as a woman or a member of a marginalized community can
scary. On top of this, running on some roads, no matter who you are, can be very dangerous. Between distracted drivers, small road shoulders, and bad terrain,
enjoying this sport can be very dangerous. 

This project would help to inform athletes about dangerous areas around them for running. Eventually, runners will be able to report incidents in their area, and
roads will be given "Safety Scores" based on the number of incidents and quality of roads as reported by runners.

Furthermore, the teams feature will encourage runners to meet up in groups to run so they can feel safe while running. All runners starting running teams will be
required to verify their identity. It is far too often an occurrence that women/members of marginalized communities are harassed while running, and running with
a group can help promote safety.
